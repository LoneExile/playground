# Playground

The Playground is a repository where I store various pieces of code that don't
quite fit into my note-taking app. It's a solution to the common problem of "I
know I've done this before, but how did I do it?"

Currently, this repository contains two main directories:

- `code`: This directory contains snippets of code I've written in the past. It
  serves as a quick reference for me to revisit and reuse code when needed.

- `cookbook`: This directory contains unpolished notes, quick setups, and
  solutions that aren't quite ready to be published as blog posts. It's a space
  where I experiment and play around with different ideas. I also use it to
  quickly share solutions with friends.
